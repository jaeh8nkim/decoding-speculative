      "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the problem says Gary bought a large beverage and drank m/n of it, where m and n are coprime positive integers. Then, if he had purchased half as much and drunk twice as much, he would have wasted only 2/9 as much beverage. We need to find m + n.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Gary originally bought a certain amount, let's say the total beverage is T. Then he drank m/n of T, so the amount wasted is T - m/n * T = T(1 - m/n). Then the problem says, if he had bought half as much, so T/2, and drank twice as much, which would be 2*(m/n)*T, then the wasted amount would be (T/2) - 2*(m/n)*T. And this wasted amount is said to be 2/9 as much as the original wasted amount. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, so the original wasted amount is T - T*(m/n) = T*(1 - m/n). The new wasted amount, after buying half and drinking twice, is (T/2) - 2*(m/n)*T. According to the problem, this new wasted amount is 2/9 of the original wasted amount. So, let's write that equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me write the equations step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Original wasted amount: W_original = T*(1 - m/n)\n",
      "\n",
      "New wasted amount: W_new = (T/2) - 2*(m/n)*T\n",
      "\n",
      "And the relationship given is that W_new = (2/9)*W_original\n",
      "\n",
      "So substituting the expressions:\n",
      "\n",
      "(T/2) - 2*(m/n)*T = (2/9)*(T*(1 - m/n))\n",
      "\n",
      "We can factor out T from both sides. Since T is the total beverage, assuming T is not zero, we can divide both sides by T:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1/2) - 2*(m/n) = (2/9)*(1 - m/n)\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this is an equation involving m/n. But we also know that m and n are coprime positive integers. So, let's let m/n = x for simplicity, where m and n are coprime. Then, the equation becomes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1/2 - 2x = (2/9)*(1 - x)\n",

      "Let me write this equation again:\n",
      "\n",
      "1/2 - 2x = (2/9)(1 - x)\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, solve for x. Let's multiply both sides by 18 to eliminate denominators. 18 is a common multiple of 2 and 9.\n",

      "Compute each side:\n",
      "\n",
      "Left side: 18*(1/2) - 18*2x = 9 - 36x\n",
      "\n",
      "Right side: (18/9)*2*(1 - x) = 2*2*(1 - x) = 4*(1 - x) = 4 - 4x\n",

      "Divide both sides by -32:\n",
      "\n",
      "x = (-5)/(-32) = 5/32\n",

      "Original amount: Suppose T is 1 (since it's a ratio, we can assume T = 1 for simplicity). So Gary drank 5/32 of T (which is 5/32), so wasted is 1 - 5/32 = 27/32. Then, if he bought half as much, T/2 = 1/2, and drank twice as much, so 2*(5/32) = 10/32 = 5/16. So the wasted amount would be 1/2 - 5/16 = 8/16 - 5/16 = 3/16. The original wasted amount was 27/32. Then, according to the problem, the new wasted amount should be 2/9 times the original.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compute 2/9 * (27/32) = (2*27)/(9*32) = (54)/(288) = 9/48 = 3/16. Which is equal to the new wasted amount. So that works out. Therefore, the answer is 5 + 32 = 37.\n",
